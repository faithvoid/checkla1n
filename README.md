![](icon.png)

# Planned Features
- All available checkra1n-based iOS jailbreaks for all iOS versions up until 12!
- Project Sandcastle support for loading Linux / Android

# Requirements
- iOS device on a version lower than iOS 12
- Raspberry Pi Zero 1-2 (W) running Raspbian Lite
- Lightning Cable (ideally OEM, or rarer, microUSB to lightning)
- 5V + 1.2A power supply (any less can cause voltage issues which may result in unsuccessful jailbreak attempts!)

# Issues
- A7 devices are currently not supported due to a checkra1n bug!
- May not be as reliable as a macOS system due to the above bug + other unspecified checkra1n Linux issues.

# TODO:
- Create web app + SPI display functionality for controlling various DFU / jailbreak features

# Credits
- checkra1n team (jailbreak utility)
- Adrian Jagielak (bypass utility)
